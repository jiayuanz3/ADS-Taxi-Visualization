# New York Yellow Taxi Visualization

This is a piece work from MAST30034 Applied Data Science Project 1(University of Melborune).

I finished this work in 09/2021 with Python programming.

In this Project, visualization of New York Yellow Taxi is achieved. It's mainly focus on three problems: 1. Hour VS Airport Trip VS Tip Amount 2. Passenger Count VS Week of Day VS Location VS Tip Amount 3. Trip Count VS Rainy VS Speed

The data is freely available to download from https: //www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.

code.ipynb is the code file, extra data is in dataset folder, plots folder gives part of the graphs generated by the program - html file with animation.
